I'm a PhD student in the <a href="http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu/"  target="_blank"> Theory Group</a> and 
<a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)</a>, fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://christianborgs.com/" target="_blank">Christian Borgs</a>
and <a href="http://jenniferchayes.com/" target="_blank">Jennifer Chayes</a>.

I'm broadly interested in theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence and mathematical economics. 
Most recently, graph theory, algorithmic game theory, statistical learning and their various intersections. 

I also think about how tools and techniques from TCS, AI and economic design 
can yield insights about important societal problems.

Before Berkeley, I graduated from  <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/"  target="_blank"> Oberlin College</a> with a BA
in <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/departments/mathematics"  target="_blank"> Mathematics</a>
and <a href="https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/"  target="_blank"> Computer Science</a>, and I'm extremely
grateful for the mentorship of <a href="https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~aeck/"  target="_blank"> Adam Eck</a>
and <a href="http://www.samueltaggart.com/"  target="_blank"> Sam Taggart</a> during my undergraduate years.
